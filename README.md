# Hey, You

* [Web version](https://zautumnz.github.io/hey-you/)
* [npm](http://npm.im/hey-you)

### Installation

`npm i -g hey-you`

If installation fails with an `EACCES` error on a Mac, try
`[sudo] npm install -g electron-prebuilt --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root` and
then try installing again.

### Usage

* CLI: `hey-you-cli`
* Electron app: `hey-you`

You can either click or press any keys, or both if you want.

`Alt-F4` or `Cmd-Q` to quit. Or just don't close it.

You can do `hey &` to just leave it open.

If this doesn't work for you, you may need to update Node.
(On Linux or Mac, try `npm i -g n && n latest`).

If it still doesn't work, please open an issue and I'll try to fix it ASAP!

## hey, you...
## you rule.
